## `ReactMarkdown` was rendering correctly before, but now there's a glitch: all text appears in **bold**, and newline characters (`\n`) are displayed literally instead of rendering as actual line breaks.   Convert escaped newline sequences to real line breaks so Markdown renders properly

> 🧑 **Me:** `GroupField` is intended to render fields within a group, typically used in sections that support multiple rows—such as **Children Needing Care**, **Family Members**, **Providers**, **Income Sources**, etc. However, there are also fields that are **not** part of a `GroupField` and still need to be processed and rendered correctly. Is there a misunderstanding here? Could this be the reason why `requiredCondition` is not functioning properly—neither for standalone fields within a step section nor for subfields inside a group?

> 🤖 **Agent:** Updated group validation to check each subfield’s condition using its record data, ensuring required and visibility logic functions properly in repeating sections

> 🧑 **Me:** Okay, the **Next** button in the **Children Needing Care** step now works after the fix. However, a similar issue exists in the **Family Members** step—if a row is added, the **Next** button does not work. If the section is left empty, the **Next** button functions as expected.

Also, when the **"Choose file"** button is clicked and the user cancels out of the file selection dialog, the previously uploaded file name disappears from beside the button, while the name displayed above still remains. Additionally, the **"DROP FILE"** hint should **always remain visible**, even after a file has been successfully dragged and dropped.

## Review the codebase to **identify gaps in accessibility compliance** and provide specific **recommendations** to address them.  Accessibility review of repository *Accessibility features present:* A “skip to main content” link appears early in App.tsx, improving keyboard navigation Images in PatternViewer.tsx include alt attributes for descriptive text Form fields in SubmitPattern.tsx have explicit labels and aria-required where needed Buttons such as the LLM helper use aria-label for icon-only controls *Potential gaps:* Navigation element lacks an accessible name. The \<nav\> element in Navbar.tsx has no aria-label or heading that identifies the navigation region. Screen readers may announce only “navigation” with no context Tag removal buttons are not keyboard focusable. In TagSelector.tsx the remove (“×”) button uses tabIndex={-1}, which removes it from the tab order, preventing keyboard-only users from deleting tags Search field missing a label. The search input in PatternList.tsx relies solely on the placeholder text, so it lacks a persistent accessible name for screen readers Decorative SVG icons may be voiced by screen readers. The inline SVG for the Google sign‑in button has no aria-hidden="true", so screen readers might announce SVG path content *Recommendations:* Add aria-label="Main navigation" (or similar) to the \<nav\> element in Navbar.tsx. Remove tabIndex={-1} from TagSelector’s “remove tag” button so it can be focused and activated via keyboard. Provide an explicit \<label\> (or aria-label) for the search input in PatternList.tsx. Mark purely decorative icons with aria-hidden="true" to avoid unnecessary screen‑reader verbosity. Overall, the project already demonstrates awareness of accessibility through labels, alt text, and skip links. Addressing the above gaps will further align the codebase with common accessibility guidance such as WCAG. Label navigation regions Make remove-tag buttons keyboard accessible Provide a label for the pattern search input Hide decorative SVG from assistive tech Allow keyboard focus on sidebar toggle

> 🧑 **Me:** When a form specification step contains **only an `InfoSection`**, skip displaying that step in the **Review Step** view.

> 🤖 **Agent:** Added logic in ReviewStep.jsx to ignore any steps where all sections are informational only, preventing them from displaying in the review page Created a new test verifying that info-only steps are skipped when rendering the review step component

> 🧑 **Me:** The **Review** step is currently displaying a raw JSON object for each step. Instead, can the data be **neatly formatted**, with **arrays of objects rendered in table format**? Also, provide a link to **"View as JSON"** that opens the raw JSON data in a popup for reference.

> 🤖 **Agent:** Implemented a reusable modal component for popup dialogs Updated the review step to render step data in tables and include a “View as JSON” popup link Added styles for formatted tables, links, and modal windows

> 🧑 **Me:** If the **Review & Submit** step allows navigation to individual steps when **Edit** is clicked, can we add a **"Back to Review Step"** link next to the step heading? This should be styled appropriately and **adjusted for mobile responsiveness** as well.

> 🤖 **Agent:** Added an optional “Back to Review step” link inside the Step component so users can easily return to the Review page when editing a step Styled the new link and header container for desktop and mobile layouts Tracked when a user is editing from the Review step and provided a handler to navigate back to it in FormRenderer Mirrored the same back-to-review functionality in DycdFormRenderer for the alternate form flow

> 🧑 **Me:** Can we make the **"Back to Review"** button **float/stick** as the user scrolls through the step from top to bottom, so it remains visible at all times?

> 🤖 **Agent:** Made the “Back to Review” button stick to the top-right corner of the scrolling area so it stays visible while navigating a form step
