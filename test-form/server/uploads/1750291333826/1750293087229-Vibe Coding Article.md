| **What do you think about the following plan?** This repository includes a JSON Form Specification file, `childcare_form.json`, which is used to generate the `FormComponent.jsx` that renders the React application (`App.js`). The application also uses `form.css`. However, the current implementation is too fragile—it's a single, monolithic structure that’s difficult to reuse or maintain. The goal is to refactor and modularize the code so that `FormComponent.jsx` can seamlessly support any new JSON Form Specification without major changes. **Task: Refactor and restructure the codebase as follows. Use Libraries:** Adopt modular UI libraries on the frontend to promote reusability, improve scalability, and maintain design consistency across services—avoiding a monolithic approach. **Shared libraries** should contain generic, reusable components with no dependency on other custom libraries. Examples: `Button`, `Card`, `Checkbox`, etc. **Core libraries** should include components that support application structure and layout. Examples: `Footer`, `TopNavigation`, `SideMenu`, etc. **File and Folder Structure Guidelines: Component Folders:** Each component should have its own folder containing its `.jsx`/`.js` file, CSS module, and test file. **Pages Folder:** Store components that represent different routes or views in the application. **Store Folder:** For reducers, actions, and models. **Constants Folder:** For enums, route paths, and local storage keys. **Helpers Folder:** Business logic utility functions. **Hooks Folder:** Custom hook functions. **Utils Folder:** General-purpose utility functions. Examples: `SSNFormat`, `getMaskedString`.  | Repository Structure React application under test-form/ with a single very large component FormComponent.jsx (\~3,000 lines) that embeds the JSON form specification directly in code. Example beginning: jsx Copy export default function FormComponent() { const form \= JSON.parse(\`{ "title": "Childcare Application Wizard", ... The JSON specification also exists as a standalone file childcare\_form.json. Its initial lines mirror the embedded string: json Copy { "form": { "title": "Childcare Application Wizard", "description": "Step-by-step form for applying for Childcare Assistance", ... App entry point App.js merely renders the form component. Styles sit in a single large form.css. The current setup results in one huge component file, tightly coupling form data, layout logic, validation, and UI rendering. The component is difficult to maintain or reuse. Suggested Refactor Your plan to modularize makes sense. Key points: Load Form Specs ExternallyInstead of embedding JSON inside the component, import the spec from separate files. This allows FormComponent to remain generic and work with any new spec. Component Library OrganizationCreate a components/ folder where each UI component (Button, Card, Field, Stepper, etc.) lives in its own folder with .jsx, .module.css, and optional test/helper files.Example: css Copy src/components/   Button/     Button.jsx     Button.test.jsx     Button.module.css  Application Structure pages/ for top-level views store/ for Redux or context logic (reducers, actions, models) constants/ for enums, paths, local-storage keys helpers/ for business logic utilities hooks/ for reusable React hooks utils/ for low-level helpers such as SSN formatting Core vs Shared Libraries Shared components (button, input, card) should be UI-only. Core components (header, footer, navigation) compose shared components and manage layout/state. Simpler FormComponentBreak out step rendering, section rendering, and field rendering into smaller components. Use hooks for validation and form state. The component’s job becomes: Load the form JSON Map steps/sections/fields to generic components Handle navigation and submission With this modular architecture, a new JSON specification can be loaded without rewriting the component. Each field type (text, checkbox, file upload, etc.) would correspond to a reusable component, making the form generator more maintainable. Potential Issues The repository currently lacks build dependencies in this environment (react-scripts not found when running tests). Setup scripts or documentation are needed if others must run npm install before testing. Existing CSS is a single file; consider splitting into module-based CSS or a design system. Overall the plan is solid: decouple data from rendering and establish a scalable folder structure for components, pages, store, constants, helpers, hooks, and utils. This will greatly improve maintainability and allow the same FormComponent to handle future JSON specs with minimal changes.  |
| The refactoring has incorrectly flattened the form specification into a single page. The original `App.js` and `FormComponent.jsx` included layout-specific logic such as: A progress indicator showing all steps Back and next buttons for step-by-step navigation Table-format layouts for sections requiring multiple entries Grouped fields (e.g., for first and second jobs) Can you review `FormComponent.jsx`, identify all the missed elements that should have been preserved or refactored, and generate a plan to address them?  | Main Findings Old FormComponent.jsx Manages wizard navigation with a vertical/horizontal stepper and “Back/Next” buttons, plus per-step validation and required-document sidebar. The layout logic spans lines showing stepper sidebar and navigation controls Handles step transitions (handleNext, handleBack) while clearing invisible fields and validating inputs Implements dynamic “group” fields with add/edit/delete rows, storing entries in table format (used for job information, etc.) Renders table layouts with copy‑schedule controls for sections requiring multiple rows (e.g., weekly schedules) Supports collapsible info sections and conditional field visibility checks before rendering fields Provides special field renderers, including file uploads, masked inputs, and validation hooks New refactored components FormRenderer.jsx simply maps over all steps and outputs them in sequence without navigation or progress indicators Step.jsx renders section content and basic fields but lacks any logic for grouping, step transitions, collapsible sections, or validation Key Missing Features Step-by-step navigation (stepper UI, “Back/Next” buttons). Validation before advancing steps and clearing hidden fields. Collapsible sections and info sections. Group fields with add/edit/delete functionality and table presentation. Table layout support with optional row-copy tools. Specialized field types (file uploads, masked inputs, multi-select checkboxes). Required-document sidebar that updates per step.  Restore wizard navigation and progress indicator Implement per-step validation Add collapsible section support Support group fields with table layout Handle special input types Display required documents sidebar  |

| Good improvements, but several defects remain from the refactoring: In the original `FormComponent.jsx`, the **Info** section content—written in Markdown—was rendered using `react-markdown`. Now, newline characters (`\n\n`) are not properly formatted, and the entire content appears bold. This suggests an issue in how the rendering logic was refactored. The form spec includes a `defaultCollapsed: true` flag for collapsible info sections in the **Instructions** step, but these sections are no longer collapsed by default. The **Applicant** step is missing the **Contact Information** section fields. Clicking **Next** does not trigger required field validation. The `conditionalRequired` logic from the form spec is not being rendered or enforced correctly. In the **Children Needing Care** step, the **Race** dropdown values are missing or empty. In the **Child/Family Needs** step, the **Reason(s) for Assistance** field allows multiple selections with a constraint of a maximum of 2 options—but this behavior is currently broken. In the **Employment** step, the **Applicant Employment Information** fields are defined as a group in the form spec, but the UI does not reflect that group configuration correctly. **Can you develop a plan to address these issues?**  | Fix Markdown rendering in InfoSection Respect \`defaultCollapsed\` in Step component Render additional basic field types Implement step validation before advancing Evaluate \`requiredCondition\` when checking fields Add CheckboxGroup component and support in Step Support multi-select with selection limits Render field groups inside sections  |
| `conditionalRequired` and `visibilityRequired` are still not functioning correctly. Clicking **Next** now triggers field validation, but when input is provided, the error messages do not clear as expected. The `CheckboxGroup` options are not vertically stacked—they should be. After entering missing fields and clicking **Next**, the following error occurs:`Invalid regular expression: /^\\(?[0-9]{3}\\)?[-. ]?[0-9]{3}[-. ]?[0-9]{4}$/: Invalid group SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /^\\(?[0-9]{3}\\)?[-. ]?[0-9]{3}[-. ]?[0-9]{4}$/: Invalid group` Please recommend a plan to fix these issues. Also, review `FormComponent.jsx` against the rest of the refactored codebase and identify any additional behavioral logic that has not yet been carried over and needs to be refactored.  | Evaluate visibilityCondition and requiredCondition in Step Clear field errors on change Stack CheckboxGroup options vertically Sanitize regex patterns before validation Initialize collapsedSections from defaultCollapsed Call cleanupHiddenFields on step advancement Audit remaining behaviors from FormComponent  |
| **Functional regressions introduced during refactoring – please review and provide a remediation plan:** When input is provided to a required field, an error message incorrectly appears stating the field is still required. In the **Children Needing Care** step, after adding a new child row and clicking **Save**, the table does not display the saved record. In the **Employment** step, the grouping for **1st Job** and **2nd Job** is now functioning, but the layout is incorrect. These two groups should be displayed side by side, with the fields in each group vertically stacked in separate columns. In the **Work/Activity/Travel Schedule** step, the **Copy Schedule From** feature, which previously worked, is now malfunctioning. It copies only a single target cell value incorrectly and does not follow the behavior defined in the form spec JSON. Fields with `visibilityRequired` and `conditionalRequired` are always displayed, regardless of the configured conditions in the form spec JSON. They should only be shown when the condition is met. Please provide plan of attack | Use functional updates in \`handleChange\` and clear nested errors Persist all row data when saving group fields Add two-column layout for employment groups Ensure table copy applies all target fields Apply conditional visibility and requirement in \`GroupField\`  |
| In the **Children Needing Care** step, the **Child Details** section's **"Add Children Needing Care"** functionality is not working. After entering input and clicking **Save**, no table appears displaying the added row. This is a regression. Refer to the **Family Members** step (**Household Member Details** section), where similar functionality is working as expected. In the **Applicant** step, the **Cash Assistance Number** field should be marked as required **only** when the answer to **"Do you receive cash assistance?"** is **"Yes"**. This behavior is correctly defined in the form spec JSON using `visibilityCondition` and `requiredCondition`, but it is currently not working. Note that this is a **single-entry field**, not part of a multi-row group. Similarly, `visibilityCondition` and `requiredCondition` are not functioning as expected for sections with multiple rows, such as **Children Needing Care** and **Family Members**. Give me plan to fix | Stop validateStep from wiping children records Make RadioGroup a controlled component Persist step data across navigation  |
| `ReactMarkdown` was rendering correctly before, but now there's a glitch: all text appears in **bold**, and newline characters (`\n`) are displayed literally instead of rendering as actual line breaks.  | Convert escaped newline sequences to real line breaks so Markdown renders properly  |
| `GroupField` is intended to render fields within a group, typically used in sections that support multiple rows—such as **Children Needing Care**, **Family Members**, **Providers**, **Income Sources**, etc. However, there are also fields that are **not** part of a `GroupField` and still need to be processed and rendered correctly. Is there a misunderstanding here? Could this be the reason why `requiredCondition` is not functioning properly—neither for standalone fields within a step section nor for subfields inside a group? | Updated group validation to check each subfield’s condition using its record data, ensuring required and visibility logic functions properly in repeating sections  |
| **Please provide a plan to fix the following issues:** In the **Add Children Needing Care** section, the **Race** field values are not being displayed. After adding a row in the **Children Needing Care** section, clicking **Next** does not proceed—the action fails silently or is blocked. The `requiredCondition` for the **Cash Assistance Number** field is not taking effect—it should be required only when **"Do you receive cash assistance?"** is set to **"Yes"**, as defined in the form spec.  | Support checkbox fields inside GroupField Revalidate entire step when a field changes Clean up unused parameter in validateStep  |
| Okay, the **Next** button in the **Children Needing Care** step now works after the fix. However, a similar issue exists in the **Family Members** step—if a row is added, the **Next** button does not work. If the section is left empty, the **Next** button functions as expected. | Revalidate entire step to clear stale group errors Clear previous section errors when group entries added  |

| Can you review `form.css` and propose a set of modern, inspiring, creative, attractive, sophisticated, and innovative styles to replace the current ones?  | Consolidate CSS variables in form.css Add modern color scheme and fonts Style stepper and buttons with gradients and smooth transitions Improve table styling Check accessibility and increase contrast where needed  |
| Review `FormComponent.jsx` against the rest of the codebase and identify any logic that exists and is used within `FormComponent`, but is missing or not carried over in the refactored code. Please provide a list of these gaps. | **Missing Features** Step Navigation Validation Original: Step links check for validation before moving to another step. jsx Copy if (i \=== currentStep) return; const currentStepFields \= steps\[currentStep\].sections.flatMap(sec \=\> sec.fields); if (\!hasErrors(currentStepFields)) { setCurrentStep(i); } Refactored: Stepper.jsx allows navigation unconditionally unless a canNavigate callback is provided (none is passed by FormRenderer). Scrolling to Top on Step Change Original: Both handleNext and handleBack scroll the page to the top. Refactored: Neither FormRenderer nor Step performs any scrolling. Masked SSN Input Detection Original: Fields with id "ssn" or labels containing “Social Security” use a masked input. Refactored: Step.jsx only handles a type of "tel" via MaskedInput. There is no SSN-specific check. File Field Example Hints Original: File inputs display example text from metadata.examples. Refactored: FileInput.jsx simply renders a file picker without displaying examples. Group Entry Validation Original: Group sections validate required subfields before saving. Refactored: GroupField.jsx adds or edits entries without validating required fields. Touched‑Based Error Display Original: The component keeps a touched state and only sets it when a user interacts, controlling when errors appear. Refactored: Step.jsx recomputes all errors on every change and has no touched tracking, so untouched fields may show errors immediately. These disparities mean that while the refactored components reproduce much of the form rendering, user experience behaviors—particularly validation flow, scrolling, and certain UI hints—differ from the original FormComponent.jsx.  |
| Okay, please provide a plan to fix and address these issues within the refactored modular code.  | **Step Navigation Validation** Observation **Stepper.jsx includes a canNavigate callback but FormRenderer.jsx does not provide one. Clicking any step always moves without validation. jsx Copy const handleClick \= (idx) \=\> { if (idx \=== currentStep) return; if (canNavigate && \!canNavigate(idx)) return; onStepChange && onStepChange(idx); }; In the monolithic component, step links checked hasErrors before allowing navigation. jsx Copy onClick={() \=\> { if (i \=== currentStep) return; const currentStepFields \= steps\[currentStep\].sections.flatMap(sec \=\> sec.fields); if (\!hasErrors(currentStepFields)) { setCurrentStep(i); } }}** Plan Expose a **canNavigate function from FormRenderer that validates the current step using validateStep and existing step data. Pass this callback to Stepper. In Stepper, retain the canNavigate check as shown above. 2\. Scroll to Top on Step Change** Observation The legacy **handleNext and handleBack scrolled to the top of the window after changing steps. jsx Copy setCurrentStep(currentStep \+ 1); window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "auto" });** Plan After calling **onNext or onBack inside Step (or after changing steps in FormRenderer), call window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'auto' }). 3\. Masked SSN Input Detection** Observation Old code rendered a **MaskedInput whenever the field id was "ssn" or the label contained “Social Security.” jsx Copy else if (id \=== "ssn" || label.toLowerCase().includes("social security")) { return ( \<MaskedInput mask\="000-00-0000" ... /\> ); } Step.jsx only checks for type="tel" to choose MaskedInput. No SSN logic exists. Plan In Step.jsx (and inside GroupField.jsx for grouped fields), add a condition checking field.id \=== 'ssn' or label text for “social security.” Render MaskedInput with SSN mask when true. 4\. File Field Example Hints** Observation Original component showed example text from **metadata.examples. jsx Copy {metadata?.examples && ( \<div className\="form-hint text-sm text-gray-500 italic mt-1"\> Examples: {metadata.examples.join(", ")} \</div\> )} FileInput.jsx currently displays only a file picker. Plan Extend FileInput (or the place in Step.jsx where file fields are rendered) to optionally display the hint block when field.metadata.examples is present. 5\. Group Entry Validation** Observation Legacy **renderGroupField validated required subfields before adding or editing an entry. jsx Copy const validate \= () \=\> { const errs \= {}; field.fields.forEach(f \=\> { if (f.required && \!currentEntry\[f.id\]) { errs\[f.id\] \= 'Required'; } }); setGroupErrors(prev \=\> ({ ...prev, \[fieldId\]: errs })); return Object.keys(errs).length \=== 0; }; const handleSave \= () \=\> { if (\!validate()) return; ... }; The refactored GroupField.jsx saves entries without validation. jsx Copy const handleSave \= () \=\> { const updated \= \[...entries\]; ... onChange && onChange(updated); ... };** Plan Implement a similar **validate function in GroupField.jsx. When saving, ensure all required subfields are present; display per-field errors and prevent saving if validation fails. 6\. Touched-Based Error Display** Observation The old component stored **touched state so errors appeared only after a user interacted. jsx Copy const \[touched, setTouched\] \= useState({}); const error \= touched\[id\] && formErrors\[id\]; Step.jsx recomputes errors and displays them immediately: jsx Copy const \[errors, setErrors\] \= useState({}); ... const result \= validateStep({ sections }, next, \[\], {}); setErrors(result.errors);** Plan Introduce a **touched state object in Step.jsx. On each input’s onChange or onBlur, mark that field as touched. When computing errors, display them only if touched\[field.id\] is true. Pass the touched status back through onDataChange so that re-entering a step preserves which fields have been interacted with.  Implementing these updates across FormRenderer, Step, Stepper, FileInput, and GroupField will bring the refactored modular code closer to feature parity with the original FormComponent.jsx.**  |
| Take a close look to determine why the `visibilityCondition` and `requiredCondition` functionality is not working in the refactored modular code. Analyze this logic in depth within `FormComponent.jsx`, and compare it to the original implementation to identify the root cause. |  **Copy Worked for 2m 22s The legacy FormComponent.jsx uses a single formData object for all steps. Field rendering checks a combined condition: jsx Copy const conditionToCheck \= visibilityCondition ?? (requiredCondition?.condition || requiredCondition); *// fallback* const shouldRender \= conditionToCheck ? evaluateCondition(conditionToCheck, formData) : true; if (\!shouldRender) return null; When any field value changes, the component revalidates every other field whose requiredCondition references that field, ensuring visibility and requiredness stay in sync across steps: jsx Copy const handleChange \= (id, value) \=\> { setFormData(prev \=\> { const updated \= { ...prev, \[id\]: value }; steps.forEach(step \=\> { step.sections.forEach(section \=\> { if (Array.isArray(section.fields)) { section.fields.forEach(f \=\> { if (f.requiredCondition?.condition?.field \=== id) { validateField(f.id, updated\[f.id\]); } }); } }); }); return updated; }); setTouched(prev \=\> ({ ...prev, \[id\]: true })); validateField(id, value); }; The modular refactor splits data by step. FormRenderer.jsx stores stepData per step and passes only the current step’s data to Step.jsx: jsx Copy const \[stepData, setStepData\] \= useState({}); ... \<Step key={steps\[currentStep\].id} title={steps\[currentStep\].title} sections={steps\[currentStep\].sections} ... formData={stepData\[steps\[currentStep\].id\] || {}} onDataChange={handleDataChange} /\> Inside Step.jsx, field visibility is determined only by visibilityCondition, defaulting to true if absent: jsx Copy const visible \= field.visibilityCondition ? evaluateCondition(field.visibilityCondition, formData) : true; const isRequired \= field.requiredCondition ? evaluateCondition( field.requiredCondition.condition || field.requiredCondition, formData ) : field.required; if (\!visible) return null; Because formData here includes only the current step’s fields, any condition that references values from other steps evaluates against undefined. Moreover, the fallback that used requiredCondition to control visibility (present in FormComponent.jsx) is absent. As a result: Fields whose requiredCondition determines visibility are rendered even when the condition is false. Conditions referencing fields from previous steps fail, since the data isn’t available in the per-step formData. Therefore, the visibilityCondition/requiredCondition logic breaks in the refactored code primarily because each step only receives its own slice of data and because Step.jsx dropped the fallback visibility check that FormComponent.jsx performed. To restore the original behavior, conditions must be evaluated against the combined form data across all steps and requiredCondition should be used as a visibility fallback when no explicit visibilityCondition is provided.**  |
| Okay, please help me with a plan to address and fix the issues outlined above.  | **Missing Behaviors Static inspection of FormComponent.jsx reveals several behaviors that are not present in the modular refactor (FormRenderer, Step, GroupField, etc.). Visibility fallback to** requiredCondition **In FormComponent.jsx, if a field lacks a visibilityCondition but has a requiredCondition, that condition is also used to determine whether to render the field. Step.jsx only checks visibilityCondition, so fields whose visibility depends solely on requiredCondition are always shown. Cross‑step condition evaluation The monolithic component evaluates conditions against the entire formData object. Step.jsx evaluates conditions using only the current step’s data, so conditions referencing fields from other steps fail. Section error cleanup when returning to a step FormComponent.jsx clears stale section‑level errors whenever a step becomes active and its group fields contain data. The refactored code lacks this cleanup logic, so old errors may persist even when a section is valid. Telephone field masking by id/label The original component renders a phone mask when the field id contains “telephone” or the label includes “phone.” Step.jsx only masks fields explicitly typed as "tel"; ids/labels are ignored. Optional group label Group headings in the legacy implementation can display “(Optional)” based on ui.optionalGroup. The new components render group labels but ignore this optional indicator. Use requiredCondition as visibility fallback** Evaluate conditions with full form data Clear stale section errors on step entry Phone mask detection by id/label Show optional indicator for groups  |
| Great. Earlier, you refactored the code to include a `touched` check, but before that, validation was triggered on every field change. After introducing the `touched` logic, did you also update the code to **stop validating and reporting errors on every data input**, and instead show errors **only when navigating away from the current step**?  | **Validate current step on navigation in Stepper Scroll to top on step change Add SSN mask detection Display file field example hints Validate subfields in GroupField** Only validate on navigation in Step.jsx  |
| Okay, listen—when navigating away from a step, the app correctly performs validation and displays errors. That part works well. However, when input is provided to correct an errored field, the error does **not** clear. Please suggest a plan to fix this behavior so that when a user corrects the input for a previously errored field, the error message disappears appropriately. You may need to leverage the `touched` state to reset or clear the error.  | **Revalidate field on change to clear errors**  |
| **Revalidate field on change to clear errors** Okay, now two additional issues: When a field is required in the current step, clicking the **Back** button works as expected. However, clicking directly on a **previous step name** in the step navigation does **not** allow navigation—it gets blocked. When entering a value in a **group subfield** and saving the row, validation errors are correctly shown if other required inputs are missing. However, if the inputs are then cleared (leaving the row with no values), the errors **do not** disappear as expected. Please propose a plan to address both issues.  | **Allow backward navigation without validation Reset group entry errors when entry is empty**  |
| Okay, now we need to add an Address Autocomplete feature using the Google Places API, and ensure that no CORS errors occur in the process. Can you please suggest a plan to implement this?  | **Create Express proxy for Google Places** Add AddressAutocomplete component Integrate AddressAutocomplete into Step rendering  |
| When I run `npm run dev` and start typing an address in the **Street Address** field, the autocomplete feature is not functioning.  | **Rewrote AddressAutocomplete to be a controlled component that fetches suggestions for the value provided by its parent and returns the selected text via onChange Updated Step so the street address field passes plain text to the new AddressAutocomplete handler Updated GroupField to pass text values from AddressAutocomplete correctly when editing grouped entries**  |
|  |  |
| Where is my request about ensuring a **consistent font** is applied across **all form fields**?  | **Apply consistent font styles to all form inputs**  |
|  Okay, now can you revise the **Street Address** field to include a **search icon** on the right end of the input, so users recognize it as a search/autocomplete field? Also, once an address is selected, can you temporarily display it as a **placeholder** while other form fields are being auto-populated, and ensure that only the **street address component** is shown in the Street Address field itself?  | **Introduced a placeholder state to manage full address text after selection Passed this placeholder to the Street Address field and updated the value to only the street portion after populating other fields Added a search icon to the autocomplete input and padded the input for spacing Applied the same placeholder logic within grouped fields for consistency** |
| Dropdown fields such as **Marital Status** and **Relationship to Applicant** currently show the first value by default. However, when navigating away from the step, the field still shows a validation error saying input is required. Should these dropdowns instead use a default option like **"Select \<Field Name\>"** to prompt user selection explicitly? Can you review how this was handled in `FormComponent.jsx` before the refactoring to see if there are any relevant hints or logic we missed?  | **Add placeholder support for SelectField and use it in Step/GroupField**  |
| I'm not satisfied with the current `form.css`. Surprise me with a **professional yet modern design**—including proper spacing, font sizing, color themes, and overall visual polish. | **Added Inter font import and updated CSS variables to use an indigo and emerald color scheme with refined spacing and shadows Modernized stepper styles with borders and gradients for active steps Increased padding on the main form container for a cleaner look Adjusted form section margins and grid spacing for improved layout**  |
| Gosh, it's still using a **purple-teal gradient**—is that really a professional, modern look?  |  |
| Can you review `form.css` and clean up any unused styles across the codebase? Exclude styles that are referenced **only in `FormComponent.jsx`**—those should still be considered in use.  |  |

| The current design system—covering color themes, font family, sizing, spacing, table formatting, card styling, and more—is **not at all acceptable** for an enterprise-grade application, especially for a top-tier, progressive city government platform. Please suggest the changes needed to elevate the design system to meet the expectations of a **modern, professional, and high-quality civic application**.  | **The project’s primary styles live in test-form/src/form.css. Colors, fonts, border radii, and other variables are set directly in a :root block and used throughout the components. For instance, the palette and typographic defaults are defined here. Inline styles occur in components such as InfoSection.jsx where background color, padding, and font weights are hard‑coded instead of using shared classes. Tables and card components rely on ad hoc class names with fixed sizes and colors. This ad hoc approach is inconsistent and lacks an enterprise-grade design system. To modernize and standardize the UI for a city government application, consider these improvements: Introduce centralized design tokensCreate a dedicated stylesheet or theme module (e.g., design-tokens.css) that stores color, typography, spacing, and radius variables. Replace magic values in form.css and other files with references to these tokens. This will make future brand updates easier and ensure consistency across components. Standardize typography and spacingUse a clear typographic scale (e.g., using rem units) and consistent spacing variables (e.g., \--space-xs, \--space-sm, \--space-md, \--space-lg). Update button sizes, padding, margins, and grid gaps accordingly so the layout aligns with a cohesive visual rhythm. Adopt a professional design frameworkConsider implementing an established design system such as Material UI, Bootstrap, or the official US/NYC design guidelines. Doing so provides ready‑made accessible components, responsive grid utilities, and predefined tokens. This would replace the mix of inline and custom styles with standardized, well-documented patterns. Remove inline stylesConvert inline styles in components (e.g., InfoSection.jsx) to CSS modules or styled components that reference the shared tokens. This improves maintainability and keeps styling consistent. Improve table and card stylingThe table styles defined around lines 240‑268 include manual borders and background colors. Cards around lines 314‑388 have hard-coded shadows and colors. Refactor these components to use shared classes for table layouts and card containers, ensuring accessible color contrast and responsive sizing. Ensure accessibility and responsive designReview color contrast ratios to meet WCAG AA or AAA standards. Incorporate responsive breakpoints so layouts adapt cleanly on mobile (some responsive rules exist in form.css but are minimal). Using a framework with built-in accessibility features can help achieve this.**  |

| Revise the implementation so that an application section is **hidden** when its `visibilityCondition` evaluates to `false`. For example, if `applicant_jobs` is a section, its visibility might be configured as: `{   "id": "applicant_jobs",   "title": "Applicant Employment Information",   "description": "Enter details for up to two jobs held by the applicant.",   "visibilityCondition": {     "field": "applicant_emp_income_indicator",     "operator": "equals",     "value": "Yes"   },   ... }` What changes are required to add this show/hide feature to Section? | **Added a helper in Step to determine if a section should be visible based on its visibilityCondition Updated missing-field checks to skip hidden sections Skipped rendering sections when they are not visible and passed visibility info to each Section component Enabled Section to accept a visible prop and return null when hidden Extended cleanup logic so values of fields in hidden sections are removed**  |
| Revise the `FileInput` component so that it properly displays both the **section description** and the **file type field description**, as defined in `src/data/childcare_form.json`.  | **Render section descriptions in Step.jsx Add description support to FileInput Pass field descriptions to FileInput**  |
| Is there a way to prominently display a **"Drop Files"** hint in large font inside the dotted box for the file input? Currently, users may not realize that drag-and-drop is supported, as the dotted border alone isn't clear enough. | **Introduced a new hasFiles state and rendered a “Drop files here” hint when no files are selected, hiding it during drag events Updated styles so the file input zone is centered and added styling for the drop hint text**  |
| Is there a way to position the **file type field label and description** **outside** of the dotted file drop box? Also, while dragging a file onto the area, the **dotted border color changes correctly**, but after dropping the file, the **file name is not displayed**—making it appear as though the file wasn't uploaded. Can this be addressed?  | **ile names are now stored and displayed after files are dropped, improving feedback to the user The drop zone’s markup places the label and description outside the dotted border for clarity Added styles for the new container and file name list to support the updated layout**  |
| Okay, when uploading via the **"Choose file"** button, the uploaded file name is shown in two places: one **above** the button and one **next to** it. However, when using **drag-and-drop**, the file name is updated **above** the button, but the text next to the **"Choose file"** button still says **"No file chosen"**—which is confusing to users. This should be corrected for consistency. | **Update file drop to sync input field Hide default file input text**  |
| Okay, it works—but do we really need the uploaded file name to appear in **two places**: one above the **"Choose file"** button and one right beside it? Also, when the **"Choose file"** button is clicked and the user cancels out of the file selection dialog, the previously uploaded file name disappears from beside the button, while the name displayed above still remains. Additionally, the **"DROP FILE"** hint should **always remain visible**, even after a file has been successfully dragged and dropped. | **Simplified FileInput component to track only file names, showing the “Drop files here” prompt regardless of files selected.  Hid the browser’s default selected-file text and ensured the upload button label remains visible**  |
| When dragging a file into the drop zone, the **dotted box flickers a bit too quickly**. Is there any tuning or smoothing that can be applied to improve the visual feedback? | **The flicker happens because dragOver state is toggled on every dragover and dragleave event in FileInput.jsx. When the cursor passes over child elements inside the drop zone, these events fire repeatedly, causing the dashed border to rapidly switch between normal and highlighted styles. Snippet showing this behavior:**  **Recommended Fix** Track drag enter/leave events with a counter so the border remains highlighted until the cursor completely exits the drop zone:  |
| In **mobile view**, the **stepper** and the **form** are appearing **side by side**, whereas previously the form flowed **below** the stepper. Can you check what's causing this layout issue? Also, please generate **automated test scripts** based on the `childcare_form.json` form specification.  | **Added a Jest test to check that each step defined in childcare\_form.json is reachable via Next navigation**  |

| I want to configure a new `tooltip` property for each field, so that when a user hovers over the **tooltip icon**, the corresponding **tooltip text** is displayed.  | **Created a reusable tooltip component to show hint text on hover, styled via a new CSS module Added tooltip support to field labels across the form, allowing each field specification to include optional helper text Enabled group fields to pass tooltip data to subfields using a new property in the common props block**  |
| Can you improve the styling of the **tooltip popover** to make it look more polished and visually appealing?  | **Made the tooltip accessible via keyboard focus and added a visible class for animated display in Tooltip.jsx Redesigned the tooltip popover with themed colors, transitions, and an arrow indicator in Tooltip.module.css** |

| Generate a **back-end case management application** to view the list of **submitted applications**. When a **Case Analyst** selects an application, the data for each step should be rendered in a separate **tab**, allowing the analyst to review it efficiently. Incorporate typical, **standard back-office case worker UI features** to ensure ease of use and a streamlined review experience.  | **Documented new case management dashboard that lists and reviews submitted applications Added API endpoints and HTML views to display application data in tabs for each step**  |
| Okay, please add **elaborate tests**, with **one test file for each `.jsx` file** under the `src` directory.  | **Created ApplicationCard.test.jsx to verify rendering and button interactions Added InfoSection.test.jsx with coverage for content and toggle behavior Implemented Stepper.test.jsx ensuring step change callbacks work**  |

| Review the codebase and provide **accessibility recommendations** to ensure the application meets best practices and standards for inclusive design. | Accessibility Review The project uses React with TypeScript, shadcn‑ui components, and Supabase integration. Many components include accessibility features such as **aria-label attributes, screen-reader-only labels, and aria-live regions. However, a few areas could be improved. Strengths Language selector and many form inputs use aria-label or visible \<label\> elements for accessibility Keyboard users receive updates from toast notifications via an aria-live region Buttons and dialogs often supply proper labels and accessible markup, e.g. LLMHelperButton Issues & Recommendations** Clickable card lacks full keyboard support **PatternCard uses a \<div\> with only onClick and tabIndex={0}. There is no role or key handling for Enter/Space, so keyboard users may not be able to activate it intuitively Recommendation: Add role="button" (or convert to \<button\>/\<Link\>), and implement onKeyDown to trigger on Enter and Space. Tag input without an accessible label The tag input in TagSelector relies solely on a placeholder and lacks an explicit label or aria-label** Recommendation: Provide a **\<label\> element (possibly visually hidden) or an aria-label so screen readers can announce the field purpose. Tooltip icon isn’t keyboard accessible TooltipIcon only shows the tooltip on hover and has no focus handler or semantic role Recommendation: Allow the tooltip to appear on focus and ensure the icon has tabIndex={0} and aria-describedby linking to the tooltip text. No “Skip to main content” link Pages load directly into navigation and content without a skip link, so keyboard users must tab through the entire navbar each time. Recommendation: Insert a “Skip to main content” link at the top of the layout that becomes visible on focus.** Improve keyboard accessibility for PatternCard Label TagSelector input Make TooltipIcon focusable Provide Skip Navigation link  |

| Review the codebase to **identify gaps in accessibility compliance** and provide specific **recommendations** to address them. | Accessibility review of repository *Accessibility features present:* A “skip to main content” link appears early in App.tsx, improving keyboard navigation Images in PatternViewer.tsx include alt attributes for descriptive text Form fields in SubmitPattern.tsx have explicit labels and aria-required where needed Buttons such as the LLM helper use aria-label for icon-only controls *Potential gaps:* Navigation element lacks an accessible name. The \<nav\> element in Navbar.tsx has no aria-label or heading that identifies the navigation region. Screen readers may announce only “navigation” with no context Tag removal buttons are not keyboard focusable. In TagSelector.tsx the remove (“×”) button uses tabIndex={-1}, which removes it from the tab order, preventing keyboard-only users from deleting tags Search field missing a label. The search input in PatternList.tsx relies solely on the placeholder text, so it lacks a persistent accessible name for screen readers Decorative SVG icons may be voiced by screen readers. The inline SVG for the Google sign‑in button has no aria-hidden="true", so screen readers might announce SVG path content *Recommendations:* Add aria-label="Main navigation" (or similar) to the \<nav\> element in Navbar.tsx. Remove tabIndex={-1} from TagSelector’s “remove tag” button so it can be focused and activated via keyboard. Provide an explicit \<label\> (or aria-label) for the search input in PatternList.tsx. Mark purely decorative icons with aria-hidden="true" to avoid unnecessary screen‑reader verbosity. Overall, the project already demonstrates awareness of accessibility through labels, alt text, and skip links. Addressing the above gaps will further align the codebase with common accessibility guidance such as WCAG. Label navigation regions Make remove-tag buttons keyboard accessible Provide a label for the pattern search input Hide decorative SVG from assistive tech Allow keyboard focus on sidebar toggle  |
| The UI is currently **not mobile responsive**. Please apply the necessary fixes to ensure proper responsiveness across mobile devices.  | Added a className prop to LanguageSelector so it can be hidden on desktop or mobile as needed Introduced a hamburger button and side sheet to provide mobile navigation links and controls  |

| Upon completing the guided intake form and submitting the inputs, the final step should display a **review screen** showing the submitted data in **read-only mode**, along with the ability to **navigate back to any step** to make edits if needed. Please lay out a **plan of tasks** required to implement this functionality.  | Add review and edit functionality at the end of the intake form  1\. \*\*Extend form definitions\*\*    \* Update \`test-form/src/data/childcare\_form.json\` and \`test-form/src/data/dycd\_form.json\` to append a new step with an ID such as \`"review"\` and title \`"Review & Submit"\`.    \* Ensure this step has a property like \`"type": "review"\` so the renderer can distinguish it. 2\. \*\*Create \`ReviewStep\` component\*\*    \* New file: \`test-form/src/components/core/ReviewStep/ReviewStep.jsx\`.    \* Display all collected \`stepData\` in read‑only form.    \* For each step, show an “Edit” button that triggers \`onEdit(stepIndex)\` passed via props.    \* Include a final “Submit Application” button that calls \`onSubmit\`. 3\. \*\*Update \`FormRenderer\`\*\*    \* Import \`ReviewStep\` and detect steps whose \`type\` is \`"review"\`.    \* When current step is the review step, render \`\<ReviewStep /\>\` instead of \`\<Step /\>\`.    \* Provide handlers \`handleEdit(idx)\` to set \`currentStep\` and \`handleFinalSubmit()\` to send data via the existing application API. 4\. \*\*Wire up submission\*\*    \* Add \`handleSubmit\` in \`FormRenderer\` to POST the aggregated form data (\`allData\`, \`stepData\`, etc.) to \`/api/applications/:appId\`.    \* After a successful POST, call \`onExit()\` or display a confirmation page. 5\. \*\*Enhance navigation\*\*    \* Update the stepper component if needed so that clicking a step from the review screen invokes \`handleEdit\`.    \* Ensure \`canNavigate\` logic permits jumping back from the review step. 6\. \*\*Adjust tests\*\*    \* Add unit tests in \`FormRenderer.test.jsx\` and potentially a new \`ReviewStep.test.jsx\` to verify rendering and navigation from the review page. This will provide users with a read-only summary and editing capability before final submission. |
| When a form specification step contains **only an `InfoSection`**, skip displaying that step in the **Review Step** view.  | Added logic in ReviewStep.jsx to ignore any steps where all sections are informational only, preventing them from displaying in the review page Created a new test verifying that info-only steps are skipped when rendering the review step component |
| The **Review** step is currently displaying a raw JSON object for each step. Instead, can the data be **neatly formatted**, with **arrays of objects rendered in table format**? Also, provide a link to **"View as JSON"** that opens the raw JSON data in a popup for reference.  | Implemented a reusable modal component for popup dialogs Updated the review step to render step data in tables and include a “View as JSON” popup link Added styles for formatted tables, links, and modal windows  |
| If the **Review & Submit** step allows navigation to individual steps when **Edit** is clicked, can we add a **"Back to Review Step"** link next to the step heading? This should be styled appropriately and **adjusted for mobile responsiveness** as well. | Added an optional “Back to Review step” link inside the Step component so users can easily return to the Review page when editing a step Styled the new link and header container for desktop and mobile layouts Tracked when a user is editing from the Review step and provided a handler to navigate back to it in FormRenderer Mirrored the same back-to-review functionality in DycdFormRenderer for the alternate form flow |
| Can we make the **"Back to Review"** button **float/stick** as the user scrolls through the step from top to bottom, so it remains visible at all times?  | Made the “Back to Review” button stick to the top-right corner of the scrolling area so it stays visible while navigating a form step  |
